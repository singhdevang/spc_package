\title{Run Test on SPC Data with Visual Rule Violations}
\usage{
run_test(data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame that contains SPC data including columns for measurements,
control limits, and other SPC relevant statistics. Expected columns include
'x' for the time/date, 'y' for the data points, 'cl' for the centerline, 'lcl'
and 'ucl' for the lower and upper control limits, respectively.}
}
\value{
A ggplot object representing the SPC chart with visual indications of rule violations.
}
\description{
This function plots an SPC chart for the provided data frame, which must be structured
with specific columns from SPC analysis. It highlights rule violations in the SPC chart
by changing the color of data points according to specific SPC rules:
\itemize{
\item Red: Any point outside the control limits (3-sigma).
\item Blue: Run of eight consecutive points on one side of the centerline.
\item Green: Six or more consecutive points increasing or decreasing.
\item Black: Fifteen or more points clustering within 1-sigma of the centerline.
\item Purple: Two out of three consecutive points beyond 2-sigma from the mean.
}
}
\examples{
data <- data.frame(
  x = seq(as.Date("2022-01-01"), by = "month", length.out = 24),
  y = c(rnorm(12, 100, 15), rnorm(12, 110, 15)),
  cl = 105,
  lcl = 85,
  ucl = 125
)
result <- create_spc_data(data, 'x', 'y', 'xbar')  # Assuming create_spc_data is defined correctly
spc_chart <- run_test(result)
print(spc_chart)
