\title{Create a Customized SPC Chart with Phase Breaks}
\usage{
make_chart(
  data,
  chart_title = "",
  chart_title_size = 14,
  caption = "",
  caption_size = 8
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing the SPC data including at least the columns 'x' for dates, 'y' for measurement values,
'cl' for the centerline, 'lcl' for the lower control limit, 'ucl' for the upper control limit, and 'phase' for phase data.}

\item{chart_title}{A character string representing the title of the chart.}

\item{chart_title_size}{Numeric value defaulted at 14 but can be changed according to need.}

\item{caption}{Character string that can be used to enter source of the data on bottom right.}

\item{caption_size}{Numeric value that is defaulted at 8 but can be used to change the size of the caption.}
}
\value{
A ggplot object representing the SPC chart with categorical date handling and customized aesthetics.
}
\description{
This function generates a statistical process control (SPC) chart from provided SPC data with visual breaks at phase changes.
It treats date columns as categorical variables for plotting, applies customized aesthetics, and shows discontinuities at phase transitions.
The central line (CL) is represented as a dotted line in the most recent phase and solid lines in earlier phases.

\examples{
data <- data.frame(
  x = seq(as.Date("2021-01-01"), by = "month", length.out = 12),

  cl = 100,
  lcl = 85,
  ucl = 115,
  phase = rep(1:2, each = 6)
